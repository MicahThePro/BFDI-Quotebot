## Overview

BFDI QuoteBot harnesses the power of OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o-mini model to generate replies exclusively from a hand-curated JSON list of *Battle for Dream Island* quotes. This unique restriction ensures every response is authentic, nostalgic, and hilariously chaotic â€” capturing the wild energy of BFDI characters while maintaining a clever AI-driven conversational flow.

This project is perfect for fans, meme creators, and developers wanting to blend nostalgia with cutting-edge AI tech. Itâ€™s designed as a web app with a sleek frontend UI, clean JSON-driven backend logic, and a fully professional codebase. You get instant responses, character attributions, and a bizarre yet lovable chat experience.

## Features

- **GPT-4o-mini-powered AI** that understands context and picks the best fitting BFDI quote
- **Hand-curated JSON quote database** with 100+ iconic quotes tagged by character
- **Accurate character attribution** displayed alongside quotes for max authenticity
- **Responsive, accessible web interface** with input box, submit button, and styled quote display
- **Robust error handling** with user-friendly messages and fallbacks (yes, itâ€™ll scream "GELATIN!!" if it has to)
- **Strict GPT prompt engineering** to force quote-only responses â€” no improv, no filler
- **Dark mode support** via CSS variables (optional, but itâ€™s lit)
- **Timeout protection** on API calls so the app never freezes or hangs
- **Clean modular JavaScript** with async/await, detailed comments, and debuggable console logs
- **Easy customization** â€” add your own quotes, tweak the prompt, or style the UI as you wish
- **Open source & ready for deployment** on any static hosting platform

## How It Works

1. On page load, the app fetches a local `quotes.json` file containing all the BFDI quotes and their characters.
2. When the user types a question or statement and clicks "Talk to Me!", the input is sent along with a carefully crafted system prompt to the GPT-4o-mini model via OpenAIâ€™s API.
3. The system prompt instructs GPT-4o-mini to choose **one exact quote** from the provided list that best fits the userâ€™s input.
4. GPT returns a quote string. The app finds the full quote object (with character info) from the JSON.
5. The frontend displays the quote and character in a styled format.
6. If GPT responds with something outside the list, the app falls back to the classic "GELATIN!!" quote to keep the chaos alive.
7. The user can keep chatting with the bot for infinite BFDI madness.
